Artificial intelligence engine powered by collective intelligence for your website. Learn some interesting insights about your visitors!


== Description ==

**At Breinify, we provide an API gateway for companies to enrich the user data set for real-time personalization.**
We focus on being the single sole source of 360° understanding of individuals through collective intelligence in real-time.
We believe that to truly understand an individual’s changing personalities, needs, and interests, we have to go beyond the scope of just one website or app to collect and learn user behavior.
Thus, we built an artificial intelligence engine which infers real-time predictions specific to each individual based on the current situation.

Now our artificial intelligence engine has been packaged into our Wordpress plugin.

What our plugin will show:

* "Collective Intelligence": real-time analytics to see what other categories of Wordpress sites your visitors are also visiting

* "Current Activities": real-time analytics to show which how many of each type of activities are happening on your Wordpress site (e.g. log in, add to cart, checkout)

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
